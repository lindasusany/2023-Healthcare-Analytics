# SEIR Epidemic Model Visualization

This repository contains an interactive Shiny web application that visualizes the dynamics of an epidemiological model known as the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. The SEIR model is a valuable tool for simulating the spread of infectious diseases and exploring the impact of different parameters on disease dynamics.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Users can adjust various parameters such as transmission rate, recovery rate, progression rate, and initial population conditions using sliders.
- **Real-time Plotting**: The app generates real-time plots that show the evolution of the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations over time.
- **Parameter Exploration**: Users can experiment with different parameter values to observe how they influence the course of an epidemic.

## Usage

To run the SEIR Epidemic Model Visualization app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required R packages, including `shiny` and `deSolve`.
3. Run the Shiny app using the `shiny::runApp()` function.

## Dependencies

- R (>= 3.6.0)
- Shiny (>= 1.6.0)
- deSolve (>= 1.28)
